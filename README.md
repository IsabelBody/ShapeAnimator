# Bouncing Shapes Application

## Overview
A Java Shape Animator project I undertook for a university class in Object-Oriented Programming. This Java application, `A3`, is designed to create an interactive environment where shapes bounce around on the screen. It extends `JFrame` and utilizes Swing components for the graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface:** The application provides a graphical interface where users can add, remove, and manipulate bouncing shapes.
- **Shape Customization:** Users can select different types of shapes, paths, and customize attributes such as width, height, fill color, and border color.
- **Model-View Separation:** The application follows the Model-View design pattern, with a clear separation between the data model (represented as a tree structure) and the graphical representation.
- **Dynamic Resizing:** The interface dynamically adjusts to window resizing, maintaining the integrity of the displayed shapes.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the `A3` class. Upon launch, a window titled "Bouncing Application" will appear, presenting the bouncing shapes interface. Users can interact with the provided tools panel to manipulate shapes and observe their dynamic behavior.

## Dependencies
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Swing Library

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have JDK installed.
3. Compile and run the `A3.java` file to launch the application.
4. Explore the interface, add shapes, and experiment with customization options.
